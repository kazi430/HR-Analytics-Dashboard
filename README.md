##HR Analytics Dashboard ‚Äì Power BI Project


1Ô∏è‚É£ Project Overview

The HR Analytics Dashboard is designed to help HR professionals and management teams analyze workforce demographics, monitor attrition trends, and understand employee distribution across departments, age bands, and other key dimensions.
The goal of this dashboard is to provide data-driven insights for reducing attrition, improving workforce planning, and ensuring diversity and inclusion within the organization.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Business Objectives

Monitor employee headcount across departments and demographics.

Track attrition trends (voluntary vs. involuntary) over time.

Analyze salary distribution and average compensation.

Understand diversity metrics (gender, race, citizenship, marital status).

Provide a detailed employee view for quick HR decision-making.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Sources & Structure
Table Name	Description	Key Columns
Employees	Contains core employee data (personal, job, and demographic info)	EmpID, Name, DOB, Sex, Department, Position, Salary
Attrition	Tracks terminated employees, reasons, and dates	EmpID, Termination Date, Reason, Type (Voluntary/Involuntary)
Departments	Department-level mapping	DeptID, Department Name, Manager
Calendar	Date dimension for time-based trends	Date, Month, Year, Quarter
4Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning & Transformation (Power Query)

Removed duplicate and null entries.

Created a custom date table using DAX for time intelligence.

Converted date fields into proper Date data type.

Created calculated columns:

Age = DATEDIFF(DOB, TODAY(), YEAR)

Employee Age Band (e.g., 20‚Äì29, 30‚Äì39, etc.)

Tenure = DATEDIFF(DateOfHire, TODAY(), YEAR)

Merged Attrition table with Employee details for unified reporting.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Data Modeling (Star Schema)

Central Table: Employees

Dimension Tables: Departments, Calendar, Attrition

Relationships:

Employees[EmpID] ‚Üí Attrition[EmpID]

Employees[DeptID] ‚Üí Departments[DeptID]

6Ô∏è‚É£ Key DAX Measures
Measure Name	Formula	Description
Total Employees	COUNT(Employees[EmpID])	Total active workforce
Total Terminated	COUNT(Attrition[EmpID])	Number of employees who left
Attrition Rate %	DIVIDE([Total Terminated],[Total Employees]+[Total Terminated])	Percentage of employees who left
Average Salary	AVERAGE(Employees[Salary])	Avg salary per employee
Active Employees	CALCULATE(COUNT(Employees[EmpID]), FILTER(Employees, Employees[Status]="Active"))	Count of active employees
Terminated by Reason	COUNTROWS(FILTER(Attrition, Attrition[Reason] = "Specific"))	Termination reason count
Attrition by Department	CALCULATE([Attrition Rate %], ALLEXCEPT(Employees, Employees[Department]))	Department-wise attrition
